This site allows you to store recipes in your own online account. Users require an email address and password to access their recipes, but can view all recipes of other users and them to their collection. Users can also see the estimated cost of a recipe based on the ingredient list and quantities. There is a cooking terms glossary that will automatically add a link to keywords in a user's recipe which will link to a tutorial video on the site. The initial version of this project was in Rails, while the second version was a more dynamic site using JavaScript and AJAX."

This site allows a user to be either a team member or a team manager. It lists all of the users teams, and if they are a manager of a team, allows them to edit team information and invite players to games. A manager can upload an XLS or CSV file (which is then stored in an Amazon bucket) which populates the draw for the team's upcoming season. Team members can then sign up and add their user profiles. The user's main page will show them their list of teams, and the date and location of the next game they have. If the user is the team manager, they can then drag and drop player photos from their list of available players, and this will invite those players to the game. Team8 is a Rails site using lots of AJAX and JavaScript, CoffeeScript, HAML and JQuery."

I'm using Twilio allow users to invite new players to their game, and lots of Ruby logic and JavaScripty to make the game itself work."
